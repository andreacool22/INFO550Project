## My Project Summary
For my project, I will be analyzing deidentified data on antibiotic starts from three nursing home facilities.

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run the following bash code:

``` bash       
make
```   

This makefile will install the necessary R packages, clean the data, generate a bar graph, and create a file called Cool_Project_Report.html output in your directory that contains the results of the analysis.

For information about the rules in the Makefile, you can run the following bash code from the project folder:
``` bash       
make help
``` 

To clean up the working directory, you can run the following bash code from the project folder:
``` bash       
make clean
```
