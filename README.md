## My Project Summary
For my project, I will be analyzing deidentified data on antibiotic starts from three nursing home facilities.
To analyze the data you will need R and you will need to install some R packages. The required packages can be installed using the R command "install.packages()". The following packages will need to be installed: 
+      dplyr
+      tidyverse
+     lubridate
+      table1

## Execute the analysis
To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run the following bash code:
+       Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('Cool_Project.Rmd')"
    

This will create a file called Cool_Project.html output in your directory that contains the results.
